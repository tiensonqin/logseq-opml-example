You can see all the times you thought about [[Productivity]] and [[Habit Creation]] in their separate nodes and areas of your graph, but you never thought to connect the two. But since you wrote [[Productivity]] and happened to mention [[Habit Creation]] 4 months ago (in some random journal or essay), that proximity and connection live with you forever, even if you never drew the lines in your own head:" _note="  ![image.png](/assets/pages_knowledge_graph_1612308816189_0.png){:height 338, :width 468}&#10;"/>
